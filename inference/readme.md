This directory provides a bunch of notebooks to get started using Stable Cascade, as well as guides to download the models you need.
Specifically, you can find notebooks for the following use-cases:
- [Text-to-Image](text_to_image.ipynb)
- [ControlNet](controlnet.ipynb)
- [LoRA](lora.ipynb)
- [Image Reconstruction](reconstruct_images.ipynb)

### But wait
Before you open them, you need to do two more things:
1. Install all dependencies that are listed [here](../requirements.txt). Simply do `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Additionally, you need to download the models you want. You can do so by taking a look [here](../models)
and follow the steps.

## Remarks
The codebase is in early development. You might encounter unexpected errors or not perfectly optimized training and
inference code. We apologize for that in advance. If there is interest, we will continue releasing updates to it,
aiming to bring in the latest improvements and optimizations. Moreover, we would be more than happy to receive
ideas, feedback or even updates from people that would like to contribute. Cheers.
