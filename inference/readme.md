This directory provides a bunch of notebooks to get started using Stable Cascade, as well as guides to download the models you need.
Specifically, you can find notebooks for the following use-cases:
- [Text-to-Image](text_to_image.ipynb)
- [ControlNet](controlnet.ipynb)
- [LoRA](lora.ipynb)
- [Image Reconstruction](reconstruct_images.ipynb)

### But wait
Before you open them, you need to do two more things:
1. Install all dependencies that are listed [here](../requirements.txt). Simply to `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Additionally, you need to download the models you want. You can do so by taking a look [here](../models) 
and follow the steps.
